üé¨ **Movie Recommendation System**
üöÄ** Project Overview**
The Movie Recommendation System is a machine learning-based project that provides movie suggestions to users based on their input. Users can enter the name of a movie they have already watched, and the system will recommend similar movies using two different models:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
The project features an interactive Streamlit user interface where users can:

Input a movie title.
Choose the recommendation model (KNN or SVD).
Receive relevant movie recommendations.

üåü **Features**
Dual Model Recommendations: Allows users to select between KNN or SVD models for generating movie recommendations.
Interactive UI: Built using Streamlit for a clean and user-friendly experience.
Dynamic Suggestions: Input any movie name to see similar movie suggestions instantly.
Model Details: KNN provides similarity distances, while SVD gives recommendations based on collaborative filtering.

üñ•Ô∏è** Tech Stack**
Python: Core programming language.
Streamlit: For building the user interface.
Scikit-Learn: Implementation of KNN and SVD models.
Pandas: Data manipulation and preparation.
NumPy: Numerical computations.

üì∏** User Interface Snapshot**
Below is a snapshot of the system when a user inputs the movie "Inception (2010)":

Input: "Inception (2010)"
Model: KNN and SVD options.
Output: Lists of similar movie recommendations.

The system displays a list of movies similar to the input movie.
KNN Model: Provides similarity distances for each recommendation.
SVD Model: Suggests movies based on collaborative filtering.
